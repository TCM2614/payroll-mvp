# Release Notes (Lint / Build Status)

## Current Status

- ✅ `npm run build` (production build) succeeds.
- ⚠️ `npm run lint` reports known legacy eslint issues (documented in `docs/TECH_DEBT.md`).

These lint findings are currently treated as **non-blocking for deployment**. A dedicated
“Refactor & Lint Cleanup” sprint will address them without changing user-facing behaviour.
